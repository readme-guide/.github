**Tutorials, guides, and more!**

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ **Ryan Parman** (thatâ€™s me) has been passionate about writing since the late 80â€™s when he wrote his first short story about being a world-saving spy. Since then, heâ€™s written _volumes_ in the form of hand-written letters, lyrics, poems, short stories, technical documentation, guides, and other things. He is a software engineer (and former musician) by trade, who also has a passion for teaching and educating.
